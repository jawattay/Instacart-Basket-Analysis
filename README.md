# CF-Instacart-Analysis

Analysis of Instacart data via Python

## Objective

As an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but executives want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Analysis Factors

●	The sales team must be informed about the peak days and hours of activity to strategically place advertisements during periods of lower order volume.

●	The sales team is interested in identifying specific times of the day when customers tend to make higher purchases, as this insight could influence the selection of products to advertise during those times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

●	Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

●	The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. 

- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
    
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
    
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
    
- What different classiﬁcations does the demographic information suggest?Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
    
- What differences can you ﬁnd in ordering habits of different customer proﬁles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
